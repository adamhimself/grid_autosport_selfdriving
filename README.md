# Self driving race car project

### Summary

The ultimate goal of this project is to allow a race car to navigate around a given track, in the fastest time possible, and as autonomously as possible, using raw pixel input.
This project is inspired and derived from Sentdex's project on GTA V self-driving and leverages OpenCV and Xbox 360 controller emulation to deliver outputs back to the game.
